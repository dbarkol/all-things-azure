## Introduction

**All Things Azure** is a Microsoft Developer Blog series focusing on developer how-tos, use cases, and solutions on Microsoft Azure. This repository serves as the companion to the blog posts on *All Things Azure*, providing sample code, demos, and resources that complement the articles. Many blog posts in *All Things Azure* link to this repo for hands-on examples, enabling readers to explore the concepts discussed in the articles in a practical way.

## Repository Purpose

- **üí° Blog Companion** ‚Äì The content here directly **complements the [All Things Azure blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/)**. Each folder or file in this repository corresponds to one or more blog posts, offering code and configurations as an extension of the written tutorials.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Sample Code & Demos** ‚Äì You‚Äôll find working sample projects, scripts, and demonstrations for various Azure scenarios (AI, app development, DevOps, cloud architecture, and more). These examples are intended to help you jump-start your own projects by showing how to implement solutions described on the blog.
- **üìÅ Resources & Guides** ‚Äì In some cases, the repository includes detailed guides or configuration files referenced in the blog. For instance, if a blog post outlines a solution, the accompanying content here might include deployment templates, code notebooks, or configuration YAML/JSON to replicate that solution.

## üîó Related Blog Posts and Samples

Below are a few featured blog posts from *All Things Azure* and the corresponding resources available in this repository. We highly recommend reading the blog posts for full context, then using this repo to dive into the implementation:

- **Agentic AI Explained: A Philosophical Framework for Understanding AI Agents** ‚Äì *(All Things Azure blog post by David Barkol)*. This article explores how to create AI agents with personas inspired by philosophers.  
  üìå *Code Sample*: See the [`agentic-philosophers/`](./agentic-philosophers) folder for the sample implementation. It contains code (using Semantic Kernel) to bring Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle agent personas to life. *(Read the blog post here for background: [Agentic AI Explained](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/agentic-philosophers/).)*

- **Multi-Cluster Layer 4 Load Balancing with Azure Fleet Manager** ‚Äì *(All Things Azure blog post by Diogo Casati)*. This guide shows how to set up cross-cluster layer-4 load balancing for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Fleet Manager, improving high availability and traffic distribution across multiple clusters.  
  üìå *Guide*: Refer to the markdown guide [`multi-cluster-layer-4-load-balancing-with-fleet-manager.md`](./multi-cluster-layer-4-load-balancing-with-fleet-manager.md) in this repo. It provides step-by-step configuration details and code snippets for implementing the multi-cluster load balancer as described in the blog. *(Read the full article on the blog for conceptual background and context.)*

- **Project Stormbreaker ‚Äì Running HPC Simulations on AKS** ‚Äì *(Upcoming All Things Azure post by the App Dev GBB Team)*. This example demonstrates deploying and running heavy simulation models (e.g., ADCIRC/SWAN for coastal simulations) on Azure Kubernetes Service using Terraform and containerized workloads.  
  üìå *Resources*: Check out the [`project-stormbreaker/`](./project-stormbreaker) directory for Terraform scripts, Kubernetes manifests, and documentation to reproduce the simulation environment. These resources correspond to the blog‚Äôs scenario of running complex **HPC workloads on Azure** at scale, enabling you to follow along with the deployment steps.

- **Visualize ROI of GitHub Copilot Usage** ‚Äì *(All Things Azure blog post by Xuefeng Yin)*. This guide explains how to visualize the return on investment (ROI) of using GitHub Copilot in your projects.  
  üìå *Submodule*: The [`visualize-roi-of-ghcp-usage/`](./visualize-roi-of-ghcp-usage) directory is a submodule pointing to the original repository at `https://github.com/satomic/copilot-usage-advanced-dashboard`. It contains tools and dashboards to help you measure and visualize the impact of GitHub Copilot on your development workflow. *(Read the full article on the blog for detailed instructions and insights.)*

> **Note:** More samples will be added over time as new posts are published on the *All Things Azure* blog. Be sure to watch ‚òÖ this repository for updates. We aim to keep the code up-to-date with Azure‚Äôs evolving services and best practices.

## üöÄ Getting Started 

1. **Browse the Blog** ‚Äì Visit the [All Things Azure blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/) and find a post that interests you. Each post provides the background, problem scenario, and a walkthrough of the solution.
2. **Clone the Repo** ‚Äì Grab the code by cloning this repository: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/all-things-azure.git`. You can also download it as a ZIP if you prefer.
3. **Find the Relevant Folder** ‚Äì Locate the folder or file in the repo that matches the blog post. (The names are usually similar to the blog title or topic, as listed above.) Inside, you‚Äôll find the sample code, scripts, or configuration files referenced in the article.
4. **Read Instructions** ‚Äì Many sample folders include their own README or comments to help you run the code. Make sure to read any provided instructions. The blog post itself often serves as a guide, so keep it open for reference.
5. **Run and Explore** ‚Äì Follow the steps to deploy or execute the sample in your Azure environment. You may need an Azure subscription and certain Azure services enabled (the blog post will mention prerequisites). Feel free to experiment with the code and adapt it to your needs.
6. **Provide Feedback** ‚Äì If something doesn‚Äôt work as expected or you have ideas for improvement, let us know! You can open an issue in this repo or comment on the blog post. Collaboration is welcome.
